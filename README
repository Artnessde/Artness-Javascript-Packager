Artness Javacript Packager
----------------------------------------------

Minify your servercalls from unlimited to ONE (1). You can define
several PACKS of Javascripts, e.g. one for development and one
for production use.

Compared to other Javascript-Package-Scripts this one is fully
backend driven (no way to inject XSS and stuff).

An example Call would be:

<script type="text/javascript" src="/PathTo/apfJS.php?1-0-9-1"></script>

apfJS.php?{Pack-#}-{Cache-Timeout}-{Compression-Level}-{allow-minify}

If the HOST is not running a *NIX environment Minify is globaly set
to 0, alike what you specify

### Install Notes

* if you want to use JSMin to minify the output you have to
  set a chmod 750 on JSMin/jsmin

* if you want to use the Cache, you need to chmod 777 on the
  Cache folder
